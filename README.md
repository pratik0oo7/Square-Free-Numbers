# Square-Free-Numbers
Square Free Numbers In the theory of numbers, square free numbers have a special place.  A square free number is one that is not divisible by a perfect square (other than 1).
# Problem Description
In the theory of numbers, square free numbers have a special place.  A square free number is one that is not divisible by a perfect square (other than 1).  Thus 72 is divisible by 36 (a perfect square), and is not a square free number, but 70 has factors 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35 and 70.  As none of these are perfect squares (other than 1), 70 is a square free number.

For some algorithms, it is important to find out the square free numbers that divide a number.  Note that 1 is not considered a square free number. 

In this problem, you are asked to write a program to find the number of square free numbers that divide a given number.

# Input
The only line of the input is a single integer N which is divisible by no prime number larger than 19

# Output
One line containing an integer that gives the number of square free numbers (not including 1)
